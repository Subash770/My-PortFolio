  about: `I am a passionate Software Developer from India with a strong foundation in full-stack development. 
  I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering and have undergone professional training at Revature, where I honed my skills in ReactJS, Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and other cutting-edge technologies.
  With hands-on experience in building scalable microservices and designing seamless frontend interfaces, I aim to deliver robust and user-friendly web applications.

Over the years, I've worked on projects ranging from e-commerce platforms to innovative IoT solutions like the 'Bio-inspired Octobot for child rescue,' which earned recognition at the IEEE Madras Student Paper Forum. My portfolio includes dynamic projects, such as the Spinner and Prixima websites, showcasing my versatility in frontend development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

Currently, I'm enhancing my expertise in ReactJS and Spring Boot while contributing to open-source projects and writing technical articles for platforms like GeeksforGeeks. I thrive on learning, solving complex problems, and creating impactful software solutions that make a difference.`,
